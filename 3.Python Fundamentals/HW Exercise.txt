Scenario:
You are a Data Scientist working for a consulting firm. One of your colleagues from the Auditing department has asked you to help them assess the financial statement of Organisation X

You have been supplied with two lists of data:
    Monthly revenue
    Monthly expenses for the financial year in question. 

Task is to calculate the following financial metrics:

1.Profit for each month.
2.Profit after tax for each month(the tax rate is 30%.
3.Profit margin for each month - equals to profit after tax divided by revenue.
4.good months - where profit after tax was > the mean of the year.
5.bad months - where profit after tax was < the mean of the year.
6.the best month - where profit after tax was max of the year.
7.the worst month - where profit after tax was min of the year. 


All results need to be presented as lists

Results for dollar values need to be calculated with $0.01 precision, but need to be presented in Units of $1000 (i.e., 1k) with no decimal points

Results for profit margin ratio need to be presented in units of % with no decimal points

NOTE: Your colleague has warned you that it is okay for tax for any given month to be negative(in accounting terms, negative tax translates into a deferred tax asset)
